# Markdown Blog

This blog was developed by following the video tutorial "NextJS 14 Markdown Blog: TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, MDX, Velite" by Jolly Coding. You can find the tutorial on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/tSI98g3PDyE?si=skFA_NN7F6kJ1ZfX) or visit the [Jolly Coding channel](https://www.youtube.com/@JollyCoding).

I adhered to about 95% of the tutorial but opted to remove the Open Graph image generation function provided by Vercel. This function, which enhances the blog's SEO by generating social media images, is an edge function not supported by Vercel's free plan.

I will continue to update this blog with new features I learn from other tutorials. Future blog posts will also cover additional coding projects and tutorials I explore.
